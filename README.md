# ESS - basic ROS test

The task was to make the ros turtle draw a "Haus vom Nikolaus" and to fix any errors we could find.
The ros_test.launch starts the default square program and the inf.launch starts the infinity program.
Both have been fixed and improved.
By launching the nicolaus.launch the turtle will draw a "Haus vom Nikolaus".
